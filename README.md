# Corona-tracker
A registry to help doctors track the symptoms of large amounts of patients real time with a dashboard.

## DRAFT
After chatting with the ER doctor and Systems Architect on March 13th 2020, we scoped down some issues of critical importance. to this.

And EHR is too ambitious in scope. However [@BrianHHough took down some great notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15DekMbBnLjWSk_hAQclLzTFBCYygyeMGkGknJrBHnnM/edit?usp=sharing) that @SomeMoosery and @tesla809 will add to.

There are various ideas that people can choose from there.

However, we are looking towards creating this repo that is do-able and useful according to the ER doctor.

## Idea
The idea is to help doctors monitor large numbers of patient's symptoms over time (daily or less). Text them if they are feeling ok, or call them if they start to get worse. Or refer them to telemedicine service like Jamaica Hospital or other.

We will scope it out to creating a dashboard and a survey that people update daily with information.

## UX/UI
Dashboard (we can find a free one from Creative Tim) or open source version.
A survey screen.
Geolocation (?)

## Privacy
We have to address privacy issues. Perhaps use blockstack?
